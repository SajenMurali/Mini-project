## Title of the Project
Smartphone Usage and Sleep Quality: Insights and Predictions with Additional Validation Using Smartwatch Data is a data-driven study that examines how daily smartphone usage patterns influence sleep quality. The project combines self-reported data (such as screen time, bedtime, and perceived sleep quality) with objective smartwatch sleep metrics to create a hybrid, research-grade dataset. Using statistical analysis, data visualization, and machine learning models, the study identifies key relationships between phone usage habits and sleep outcomes, predicts sleep quality levels, and validates findings using smartwatch data for improved accuracy and reliability.

## About
Smartphone Usage and Sleep Quality: Insights and Predictions with Additional Validation Using Smartwatch Data is a comprehensive data science project aimed at understanding the relationship between smartphone usage habits and sleep quality among individuals. In today’s digital era, excessive smartphone use—especially before bedtime—has raised concerns about its impact on sleep duration, sleep efficiency, and overall sleep health. This project seeks to scientifically analyze these effects using both subjective and objective data sources.

The study involves collecting self-reported data from participants through structured online forms, including variables such as daily smartphone screen time, phone usage before sleep, bedtime routines, wake-up time, perceived sleep quality, and daytime tiredness. To improve the reliability and accuracy of the analysis, this data is validated and enhanced with smartwatch-based sleep data, such as total sleep duration, deep sleep time, light sleep time, number of awakenings, and overall sleep efficiency. The combination of these two data sources creates a hybrid, research-grade dataset that reduces bias and strengthens the findings.

Once the data is collected, extensive data preprocessing and cleaning are performed to handle missing values, remove inconsistencies, and standardize measurements (for example, converting sleep duration into decimal hours). Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) techniques, including visualizations and statistical summaries, are then applied to identify patterns and correlations between smartphone usage behavior and various sleep parameters. This helps in understanding trends such as how increased screen time or late-night phone usage affects sleep quality and sleep fragmentation.

Following the exploratory phase, machine learning models are developed to predict sleep quality levels based on smartphone usage features. Models such as linear regression, decision trees, or classification algorithms are used to estimate outcomes like sleep quality rating or sleep efficiency. The performance of these models is evaluated using appropriate metrics, and predictions are cross-checked with smartwatch data to ensure consistency and validity.

The final outcome of the project provides actionable insights into how smartphone habits influence sleep health and demonstrates how combining subjective survey data with objective wearable data leads to more accurate and trustworthy conclusions. This project has practical applications in health analytics, behavioral research, and personalized wellness recommendations, and it highlights the importance of responsible smartphone usage for improving sleep quality
